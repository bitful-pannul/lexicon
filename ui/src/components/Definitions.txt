draft for component that takes a list of definitions [typed and everything],

How should a space even look? 

[~nut/florida] <- choose/change space.

    [word (should also have stars?)] most-upvoted-def]
    [word (should also have stars?)] most-upvoted-def]
    [word (should also have stars?)] most-upvoted-def]
    [word (should also have stars?)] most-upvoted-def]

    [add-word]

    --
then if we click a specific word, route based on that ~nut/florida/florida-man
    (can also be conditionally rendered thing?)
