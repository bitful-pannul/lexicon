Different groups may have different definitions for words. They may make up their own words or give words new meanings within the context of their group. We want to support the ability to manage these group-specific lexicons, while also allowing for displaying standard definitions.

Big cheers to `~niblyx-malnus` & `~sidlup-havwen` for the help!
